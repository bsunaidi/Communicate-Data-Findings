# Bay Wheels (Ford GoBike) Data Exploration
## by Bushra Alsunaidi


## Dataset

This dataset contains information, gathered on July 2020, about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It includes about 154,967 bike trips and 13 features such as the start/end date and time, the start/end station name, the user type, and the bike type. About 72k data records were removed due to quality issues, and these columns: trip duration, start day of the week, and the start hour were added to analyze the data accordingly.


## Summary of Findings

1. There was no clear pattern in the number of bike rental per week. I think this issue is because of the time of the year (vacation season) and the pandemic of COVID-19 2020. However, there is a tendency to rent a bike on the weekends.

2. The trip duration distribution is positively skewed, and most of the trips took 8-13 minutes long.

3. Members slightly tend to rent a bike during the weekdays of July 2020 than the casual users, and vice versa. The docked bike was utilized more than the electric bike for both types of users. The electric bike is faster than the docked bike. Members ride short trips and vice versa.

4. Members mostly start their ride at '4th St at 16th St' or at 'Powell St BART Station'. However, casual users most likely start their trip at 'Market St at 10th St'.

5. the average trip duration of members is less than that for casual users on each day of the week. Nevertheless, the average is higher on the weekends for both users.

6. The demand for a docked bike is concentrated on the weekends, especially on Saturday at 2-3 PM. However, riders tend to acquire an electric bike on the weekdays around 5-6 PM. This means that in business days, people are likely to use the electric bike so they can finish their work in a faster way. Nevertheless, they utilize the docked bike in their spare days.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Casual users ride the bike more at the weekends, and they spend a longer time to reach their destination.

- It is quite interesting how people still use the docked bike in their spare time, while they can hire an electric bike that is faster. This indicates how people in San Francisco care about their health and sport even in this pandemic era.
